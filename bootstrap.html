    <pre>Highly Suspect is a rock music trio who got their start in 2009 by playing cover sets in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The band was founded by twins Rich and Ryan Meyer and their best friend, Johnny Stevens. They attended Dennis-Yarmouth Regional High School. After realizing that songwriting was their true passion, they relocated to Brooklyn, where they recorded The Worst Humans EP with producer Joel Hamilton (Elvis Costello, Plastic Ono Band, The Black Keys, Wu-Tang Clan). "Lydia", their first music video from Mister Asylum was premiered on MTV.com on June 25, 2015. Their first full-length album, Mister Asylum, was released on July 17, 2015.</pre>
